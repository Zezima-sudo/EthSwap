To interact with the contracts using this web UI please install a web3 provider such as Metamask and connect via localhost port 7545.

EthSwap is a simple web3 UI that enables interaction with two smart contracts: one being an ERC-20 altcoin, and the other an exchange contract that facilitates swaps between Ethereum and itself, and vice versa.

Built using Solidity, Web3, Truffle, Ganache, and React.

Tested with Mocha/Chai.
