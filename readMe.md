<h1>To interact with the contracts using this web UI please install a web3 provider such as Metamask and connect to the Rinkeby testnet.</h1>
EthSwap is a simple web3 UI that enables interaction with two smart contracts: one being an ERC-20 altcoin, and the other an exchange contract that facilitates swaps between Ethereum and an ERC-20 token, and vice versa.

Built using Solidity, Web3, Truffle, and React.

Tested with Mocha/Chai.
